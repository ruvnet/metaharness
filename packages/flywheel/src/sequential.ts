// @metaharness/flywheel — anytime-valid sequential testing for promotion gates.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//
// `meetsPromotionRule` is a single-shot conjunctive comparison, and it is the
// right shape: frozen, fingerprintable, every clause load-bearing. But a
// flywheel run evaluates MANY generations against the SAME holdout, and that is
// uncontrolled multiple testing. Published measurements of greedy
// "accept-if-the-score-improved" acceptance put the false-commit rate at
// 30-42%, and found 13-21 spurious modifications made even when NO true gains
// existed — degrading one agent by 4.9 points while every individual decision
// looked locally justified.
//
// The conjunctive gate plus a frozen anchor already mitigates this with
// multiple hurdles, which is real. It is not, however, anytime-valid: nothing
// in it accounts for how many times you have looked.
//
// This module adds that missing property WITHOUT touching the default gate,
// whose stability is itself the product. It composes: wrap any PromotionRule,
// and a candidate must clear both the frozen clauses AND accumulated evidence.
//
// METHOD
//
// Testing-by-betting / e-processes. An e-value is a non-negative random
// variable with expectation <= 1 under the null hypothesis ("this candidate is
// no better than baseline"). By Ville's inequality, P(sup_t E_t >= 1/alpha)
// <= alpha, so you may stop and reject at ANY time — no pre-registered sample
// size, no alpha spending schedule, and no penalty for peeking. That is exactly
// the property a flywheel needs, because it peeks by construction.
//
// The bet here is deliberately simple and assumption-light: per paired item,
// a candidate win against a baseline loss multiplies the e-value up, the
// reverse multiplies it down, and ties leave it unchanged.

/**
 * Compose a frozen gate with a sequential-evidence requirement.
 *
 * The returned rule is still a plain `PromotionRule`, so it fingerprints and
 * freezes exactly like the default one. A candidate must satisfy BOTH: every
 * clause of `baseRule`, and evidence strong enough to survive having been
 * looked at repeatedly.
 *
 * Paired outcomes are read from `evidence.pairedOutcomes` when present AND
 * non-empty (see {@link PromotionEvidence.pairedOutcomes} —
 * `runFlywheelGenerations` populates it automatically when the Evaluator
 * sets `Score.itemWins` on both sides). When absent OR an empty array, the
 * rule degrades to `baseRule` alone rather than silently blocking every
 * promotion — a caller that has not wired up per-item outcomes yet should
 * get the old behavior, not a permanently closed gate.
 *
 * This distinction matters because JS callers commonly default an optional
 * array field with `?? []` rather than leaving it `undefined` — e.g. an
 * `Evaluator` that does not (yet) populate per-item results, or one backed
 * by a suite that happens to have zero items this run. `!outcomes` alone
 * does not catch that: `![]` is `false` (an empty array is truthy in JS),
 * so a caller supplying `pairedOutcomes: []` fell through to
 * `sequentialEvidence([], …)`, which starts at `eValue = 1` with zero
 * informative pairs and can never reach the significance threshold —
 * permanently rejecting every candidate on that call site regardless of how
 * strong the base rule's own evidence is, exactly the "permanently closed
 * gate" this function's contract says it must not become. An empty array
 * carries the same "no per-item evidence supplied" meaning as `undefined`
 * here and is treated identically; it is NOT the same as a non-empty array
 * whose pairs all happen to be concordant (real data was supplied and found
 * uninformative) — that case is unchanged and still correctly rejects for
 * insufficient evidence, since data WAS in fact provided and evaluated.
 *
 * `pairedOutcomesFromItemWins` (above) already guards the same empty-vector
 * case at the point evidence is PRODUCED (both call sites: `run.ts`'s live
 * loop and `replay.ts`'s gate re-execution), so a caller going through it
 * never reaches this function with `pairedOutcomes: []` in the first place.
 * This check stays here too, defense-in-depth, for any caller that builds
 * `PromotionEvidence.pairedOutcomes` some other way.
