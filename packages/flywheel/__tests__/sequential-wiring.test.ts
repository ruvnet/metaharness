// @metaharness/flywheel — proves `sequential.ts`'s anytime-valid gate is actually REACHABLE from a live
// `runFlywheelGenerations` run, not just from its own unit tests.
//
// Before this fix: `withSequentialEvidence` was fully implemented and unit-tested (sequential.test.ts),
// exported from the package's public API (index.ts), and its own header explains exactly why it exists
// (naive greedy accept-if-improved gating has a published 30-42% false-commit rate under repeated
// evaluation). But `runFlywheelGenerations` — the ONE production code path that decides real promotions —
// never put a `pairedOutcomes` field on the `PromotionEvidence` it built for the gate, and
// `PromotionEvidence` didn't even have that field in its type. A caller who dutifully set
// `promotionRule: withSequentialEvidence(meetsPromotionRule)` got a rule that could NEVER see per-item
// evidence and therefore ALWAYS silently degraded to the plain frozen gate — identical to not having
// wired it in at all. This is the same "documented safety mechanism, structurally unreachable from its
// one real call site" bug class as ADR-278 (Tier-2 sandbox never calling `inspectVariant`).
