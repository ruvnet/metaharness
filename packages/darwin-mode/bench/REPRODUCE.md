# Reproduce every Darwin Mode result

Every claim in ADR-084…116 is backed by a committed experiment + result artifact.
This is the index: run the command, compare to `bench/results/<file>`. Build first:

```bash
npm run build        # tsc → dist/ (Tier-2 / agent experiments import dist/)
```

Conventions: **det** = deterministic & reproducible (same output every run, no
network). **agent** = runs child `node --experimental-strip-types` (Node ≥ 22, no
LLM, deterministic). **LLM** = one or more live OpenRouter calls (set
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`); costs are pennies and are *not* bit-reproducible.

| 087 | evolve mutator parity | `node /tmp/darwin-bench.mjs <repo> <model>` | `results/evolve-mutator-parity.json` | det vs LLM mutator both hit 0.985 ceiling | LLM |
| 095 | Poincaré vs Euclidean niches | `node bench/ablation/poincare-vs-euclidean.mjs` | `results/poincare-vs-euclidean-ablation.json` | Poincaré better only on depth-structured data | det |
| 099 | System audit dashboard | `node bench/system-audit.mjs` | `results/system-audit.json` | determinism 0; FDR 0.049≤0.05; nicheEntropy 0 (real) | det |

| 107 | Real-LLM eval PoC | `node bench/experiments/real-llm-eval-poc.mjs` | `results/real-llm-eval-poc.json` | real test FAIL→PASS via 1 call, $0.0005 | LLM |
| 109 | Surface gates real LLM | `node --experimental-strip-types bench/experiments/real-surface-llm-eval.mjs` | `results/real-surface-llm-eval.json` | wide window lets LLM fix; narrow can't | LLM |
| 110 | Evolution lifts real-LLM pass-rate | `node --experimental-strip-types bench/experiments/real-llm-evolution.mjs` | `results/real-llm-evolution.json` | 1/3→3/3, window 30→70, 1 cached call | LLM |

| 114 | Diversity advantage substrate-dependent | `node --experimental-strip-types bench/experiments/real-substrate-deception.mjs` | `results/real-substrate-deception.json` | agent: greedy 3/3, diversity 2/3 (not replicated) | agent |

| 116 | Retention ablation | `node --experimental-strip-types bench/experiments/retention-ablation.mjs` | `results/retention-ablation.json` | retention helps (2/2 vs 1/2); inconclusive at n=2 | agent |

DRACO (`results/draco-quality-cost-frontier.json`, ADR-037–040 lineage) and the
human-readable summary (`results/RESULTS.md`) accompany these.

Honest notes: `LLM` rows are not bit-reproducible (model nondeterminism) and the
corrected/tempered claims are 111 (window not ranking), 112 (FDR n≥5), 114
(diversity not universal), 115 (crossover not load-bearing). The full self-correcting
narrative is ADR-108 (synthesis) → ADR-111…116.
