# ADR-046: Real-Install Host Verification (and the schema bugs it caught)

**Status**: Implemented (2026-06-16)
**Project**: `ruvnet/agent-harness-generator`
**Related**: ADR-036 (host-opencode), ADR-004 (host integration), ADR-044 (capability coverage), ADR-045 (CLI host wiring)

---

## Context

ADR-044 verified hosts two ways: (1) the emitted config parses + has the
expected keys, and (2) the generated *content* is coherent to a real model via
OpenRouter. Neither feeds the config to the **actual host runtime**. The
question "are all hosts proven functional using actual installs?" exposed that
gap: only claude-code had ever been run against its real CLI (`claude -p`).

This ADR records a pass where each *feasible* host was **installed and run**.
It caught three real schema bugs that both the schema-level and live-content
checks had missed — because neither had ever started the real host.

## What was verified, and how

| Host | Real runtime exercised | Result |
|------|---|---|
| **claude-code** | `claude -p` + `claude -p --plugin-dir` (real Anthropic CLI) | ✅ runs; returns sentinel |
| **codex** | `codex 0.140.0` — `codex doctor` (config parse + MCP register) + `codex exec` via OpenRouter | ✅ config valid; runs → `CODEX_REAL_OK`. No fix needed. |
| **opencode** | `opencode 1.17.7` — `opencode run` via OpenRouter | ❌→✅ **config REJECTED**; fixed; re-run loads config + runs → `OPENCODE_CLI_FIXED_OK` |
| **openclaw** | `openclaw 2026.6.8` — `openclaw config validate` / `config schema` | ❌→✅ **"Invalid input"**; fixed; re-validate → `Config valid` |
| **pi-dev** | `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent` 0.73.1 — `pi -p` via OpenRouter | ✅ discovers our `AGENTS.md`; runs → `PI_REAL_OK` |
| **hermes** | `hermes` 0.16.0 (installed non-interactively) — `hermes config check`/`show` | ❌→✅ **schema mismatch** fixed; real hermes loads our config (`model.provider` parsed) |
| **github-actions** | `act 0.2.89` — ran the generated workflow in Docker (real runner image) | ✅ job succeeded; composite action executed |

**All 7 feasible hosts are really-run-verified.** A repeatable opt-in
`--real` mode in `scripts/verify-all-hosts.mjs` boots each installed runtime
against its scaffold (`--real-strict` to fail the gate on any attempted-but-
failed check); runtimes that aren't installed report `skip`, so CI stays green.

> **Caveat — claude-code under nested execution.** `claude -p` is verified
> against a fresh scaffold standalone (`REAL_OK`, exit 0). When the `--real`
> gate is itself run *from inside* a `claude` session, the nested `claude -p`
> flakes intermittently (CLI-in-CLI contention) — so the gate's claude-code
> check retries once and a lone in-session miss is a known artifact, not a
> harness defect. Run the gate from a plain shell for a clean 7/7.

### Resolving pi-dev + hermes (initially thought infeasible)

- **pi-dev**: the right package is **`@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`** (bin `pi`)
  — NOT `@mariozechner/pi` (`pi-pods`) or `@badlogic/pi` ("Prime Intellect
  CLI"), both of which squat the obvious names. Once found, `pi -p` runs our
  scaffold (pi natively discovers `AGENTS.md`).
- **hermes**: installs non-interactively with `bash install.sh --non-interactive
  --skip-setup` (uv + repo clone + deps, no model download, no wizard). Real
  hermes then loads our corrected config.

### Genuinely not feasible on this host (documented, not faked)

- **rvm**: an AArch64 bare-metal microhypervisor built from source — cannot run
  on this x86 host at all.
- **copilot**: requires interactive VSCode 1.99+ with a Copilot subscription —
  no headless path. (Config shape is the verified-compatible VSCode `mcp.json`.)

## The three bugs (only real installs caught these)

1. **opencode** (fixed): real opencode parses `mcp` as a direct name→server map,
   so our `mcp.servers` + `mcp.permissions` keys were read as two malformed
   servers. Correct shape: `mcp.<name> = {type:"local",command:[full array],
   enabled:true}` (or `{type:"remote",url,enabled}`); env key is `environment`;
   permissions live in a **top-level** `permission` object (`"ask"|"allow"|
   "deny"`, `bash` as a glob→decision map) — there is no `mcp.permissions`.

2. **openclaw** (fixed): real schema nests MCP under `mcp.servers.<name>` with a
   required `enabled` flag — NOT top-level `mcp_servers`. OpenClaw has no
   top-level allow/deny `permissions` concept (tool gating is the structured
   `approvals.exec`/`security.installPolicy`), so we emit only the valid
   `mcp.servers` block rather than invent rejected keys.

3. **hermes** (fixed vs template): real hermes config is a nested schema
   (`model:`, `agent:`, `skills:`, `memory:`, …) with **no** `name`/`description`/
   `system_prompt`/`scrub_*`/`agents:` top-level keys. The harness identity now
   maps to `model.provider: "auto"` + `agent.personalities.<name>` (a name→prompt
   map). Hermes-4 `<think>`/`<tool_call>` scrubbing is runtime logic, not a
   config key, so it is no longer written into the YAML.

Each fix was applied in all three codegen paths — the adapter
(`packages/host-*`), the CLI (`packages/create-agent-harness/src/host-config.ts`),
and the web-UI (`apps/web-ui/src/generator/scaffold.ts`) — and the host unit
tests updated to assert the verified-real schema.

## Decision

- Treat **real-install execution** as the top tier of host verification, above
  schema-shape and live-content checks. The OpenRouter live-content check
  (ADR-044) and schema checks remain useful fast gates, but they are NOT
  sufficient on their own — they passed on configs three real hosts rejected.
- `scripts/verify-all-hosts.mjs` scaffolds via the real `--host` path (ADR-045)
  and, under `--real`, additionally boots each installed runtime: `claude -p`,
  `codex doctor`, `opencode run`, `openclaw config validate`, `pi -p`,
  `hermes config show`, `act -l`. This is the implemented top tier (no longer a
  follow-up). Model-routed checks (opencode/pi) are gated on `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
  and skip cleanly without it.

## Consequences

- The opencode/openclaw/hermes adapters now emit configs the real runtimes
  accept (opencode + openclaw verified live; hermes verified vs the template).
- ADR-036's "pin a schema snapshot" assumption was the root cause for opencode —
  the pinned shape was never validated against a real install and had drifted.
- pi-dev/rvm/copilot remain schema-/content-verified only, with the specific
  reason each can't be run here recorded above (no silent "verified").

## 2026-08-14 — Dream Cycle: YAML mapping-key injection in the hermes path (fixed, all 3 codegen copies)

Real-install verification (above) proved the hermes `cli-config.yaml` shape
matches the real loader for well-formed harness/agent names. It never tested
adversarial names. Tonight's Dream Cycle found that `AgentSpec.name`/
`HarnessSpec.name` — a plain, unconstrained `string` at the kernel type level
— was interpolated **unescaped into YAML mapping-key position**
(`agent.personalities.<name>:`) in all three of this ADR's "byte-for-byte in
parity" codegen copies: `@metaharness/host-hermes`, the CLI scaffold's
`host-config.ts`, and the web-UI generator's `scaffold.ts`. A name containing
`:` (e.g. `evil: agent`) produced two top-level `:` on one line — reproduced,
verified against the real dist output, not a hypothetical:

```
BASELINE (pre-fix):  evil: agent: "x"     ← corrupted
CANDIDATE (post-fix): "evil: agent": "x"  ← single valid mapping entry
```

**Fix**: a `yamlKey()` helper (bare only when the string is a conventional
identifier AND not a YAML-1.1-reserved bare scalar like `true`/`null`/`123`;
quoted otherwise), duplicated in lockstep across all three files per this
ADR's existing "no shared import, kept byte-for-byte in parity" design.
Independently critiqued (`@metaharness/host-hermes` copy) —
ACCEPT-WITH-CAVEATS; the critic caught the reserved-scalar hazard pre-ship
and flagged two still-open sibling gaps (a comment-line newline-injection
present in all three files, and unescaped MCP-server `name`/`command`/`url`
*values* in the adapter's `optionalMcpYaml`) — not fixed tonight, tracked as
follow-up. 19+15+18/18 tests green across the three affected suites,
additive only. Full receipt: `docs/dream-cycle/2026-08-14-gist.md`, issue
and PR linked from `docs/dream-cycle/LEDGER.md`.

**Lesson for this ADR's "real-install" discipline**: real-install testing
proves the *happy path* against a real loader; it does not by itself catch
*input-shape* defects (unconstrained upstream types reaching structured
output unescaped). Both checks are needed — this ADR's real-install tier for
schema/runtime drift, plus adversarial-input unit coverage (now added) for
injection-class defects.
